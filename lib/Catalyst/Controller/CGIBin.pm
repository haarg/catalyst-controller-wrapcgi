=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Controller::CGIBin - Serve CGIs from root/cgi-bin

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.003

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.003';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your controller:

    package MyApp::Controller::Foo;

    use parent qw/Catalyst::Controller::CGIBin/;

    # example of a forward to /cgi-bin/hlagh/mtfnpy.cgi
    sub dongs : Local Args(0) {
        my ($self, $c) = @_;
        $c->forward($self->cgi_action('hlagh/mtfnpy.cgi'));
    }

In your .conf:

    <Controller::Foo>
        <CGI>
            username_field username # used for REMOTE_USER env var
            pass_env PERL5LIB
            pass_env PATH
            pass_env /^MYAPP_/
        </CGI>
    </Controller::Foo>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Dispatches to CGI files in root/cgi-bin for /cgi-bin/ paths.

Unlike L<ModPerl::Registry> this module does _NOT_ stat and recompile the CGI
for every invocation. If this is something you need, let me know.

CGI paths are converted into action names using cgi_action (below.)

A path such as C<root/cgi-bin/hlagh/bar.cgi> will get the private path
C<foo/CGI_hlagh_bar_cgi>, for controller Foo, with the C</>s converted to C<_>s
and prepended with C<CGI_>, as well as all non-word characters converted to
C<_>s. This is because L<Catalyst> action names can't have non-word characters
in them.

Inherits from L<Catalyst::Controller::WrapCGI>, see the documentation for that
module for configuration information.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 $self->cgi_action($cgi_path)

Takes a path to a CGI from C<root/cgi-bin> such as C<foo/bar.cgi> and returns
the action name it is registered as. See L</DESCRIPTION> for a discussion on how
CGI actions are named.

=cut

sub cgi_action {
    my ($self, $cgi) = @_;

    my $action_name = 'CGI_' . join '_' => split '/' => $cgi;
    $action_name    =~ s/\W/_/g;

    $action_name
}

=head2 $self->is_perl_cgi($path)

Tries to figure out whether the CGI is Perl or not.

If it's Perl, it will be inlined into a sub instead of being forked off, see
wrap_perl_cgi (below.)

If it's not doing what you expect, you might want to override it, and let me
know as well!

=cut

sub is_perl_cgi {
    my ($self, $cgi) = @_;

    my $shebang = IO::File->new($cgi)->getline;

    return 0 if $shebang !~ /perl/ && $cgi !~ /\.pl\z/;

    my $taint_check = $shebang =~ /-T/ ?  '-T' : '';

    open NULL, '>', File::Spec->devnull;
    my $pid = open3(gensym, '&>NULL', '&>NULL', "$^X $taint_check -c $cgi");
    close NULL;
    waitpid $pid, 0;

    $? >> 8 == 0
}

=head2 $self->wrap_perl_cgi($path, $action_name)

Takes the path to a Perl CGI and returns a coderef suitable for passing to
cgi_to_response (from L<Catalyst::Controller::WrapCGI>.)

C<$action_name> is the generated name for the action representing the CGI file.

This is similar to how L<ModPerl::Registry> works, but will only work for
well-written CGIs. Otherwise, you may have to override this method to do
something more involved (see L<ModPerl::PerlRun>.)

=cut

sub wrap_perl_cgi {
    my ($self, $cgi, $action_name) = @_;

    do {
        no warnings;
# CGIs import stuff, so putting them into this package breaks Cat 5.8
        eval ' 
            package Catalyst::Controller::CGIBin::_CGIs_::'.$action_name.';
            sub {' . slurp($cgi) . '}'
    }
}

=head2 $self->wrap_nonperl_cgi($path, $action_name)

Takes the path to a non-Perl CGI and returns a coderef for executing it.

C<$action_name> is the generated name for the action representing the CGI file.

By default returns:

    sub { system $path }

=cut

sub wrap_nonperl_cgi {
    my ($self, $cgi, $action_name) = @_;

    sub { system $cgi }
}
