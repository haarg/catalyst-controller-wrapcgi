=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Controller::CGIBin - Serve CGIs from root/cgi-bin

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.020

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.020';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your controller:

    package MyApp::Controller::Foo;

    use parent qw/Catalyst::Controller::CGIBin/;

In your .conf:

    <Controller::Foo>
        cgi_root_path cgi-bin
        cgi_dir       cgi-bin
        <CGI>
            username_field username # used for REMOTE_USER env var
            pass_env PERL5LIB
            pass_env PATH
            pass_env /^MYAPP_/
        </CGI>
    </Controller::Foo>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Dispatches to CGI files in root/cgi-bin for /cgi-bin/ paths.

Unlike L<ModPerl::Registry> this module does _NOT_ stat and recompile the CGI
for every invocation. This may be supported in the future if there's interest.

CGI paths are converted into action names using L</cgi_action>.

Inherits from L<Catalyst::Controller::WrapCGI>, see the documentation for that
module for other configuration information.

=head1 CONFIG PARAMS

=head2 cgi_root_path

The global URI path prefix for CGIs, defaults to C<cgi-bin>.

=head2 cgi_dir

Path from which to read CGI files. Can be relative to C<$MYAPP_HOME/root> or
absolute.  Defaults to C<$MYAPP_HOME/root/cgi-bin>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 cgi_action

C<< $self->cgi_action($cgi) >>

Takes a path to a CGI from C<root/cgi-bin> such as C<foo/bar.cgi> and returns
the action name it is registered as. See L</DESCRIPTION> for a discussion on how
CGI actions are named.

A path such as C<root/cgi-bin/hlagh/bar.cgi> will get the private path
C<foo/CGI_hlagh__bar_cgi>, for controller Foo, with the C</>s converted to C<__>
and prepended with C<CGI_>, as well as all non-word characters converted to
C<_>s. This is because L<Catalyst> action names can't have non-word characters
in them.

This means that C<foo/bar.cgi> and C<foo__bar.cgi> for example will both map to
the action C<CGI_foo__bar_cgi> so B<DON'T DO THAT>.

=cut

sub cgi_action {
    my ($self, $cgi) = @_;

    my $action_name = 'CGI_' . join '__' => split '/' => $cgi;
    $action_name    =~ s/\W/_/g;

    $action_name
}

=head2 cgi_path

C<< $self->cgi_path($cgi) >>

Takes a path to a CGI from C<root/cgi-bin> such as C<foo/bar.cgi> and returns
the public path it should be registered under.

The default is to prefix with C<$cgi_root_path/>, using the C<cgi_root_path>
config setting, above.

=cut

sub cgi_path {
    my ($self, $cgi) = @_;

    my $root = $self->cgi_root_path;
    $root =~ s{/*$}{};
    return "$root/$cgi";
}

=head2 is_perl_cgi

C<< $self->is_perl_cgi($path) >>

Tries to figure out whether the CGI is Perl or not.

If it's Perl, it will be inlined into a sub instead of being forked off, see
L</wrap_perl_cgi>.

=cut

sub is_perl_cgi {
    my ($self, $cgi) = @_;

    my $shebang = IO::File->new($cgi)->getline;

    return 0 if $shebang !~ /perl/ && $cgi !~ /\.pl\z/;

    my $taint_check = $shebang =~ /-T/ ?  '-T' : '';

    open NULL, '>', File::Spec->devnull;
    my $pid = open3(gensym, '&>NULL', '&>NULL', "$^X $taint_check -c $cgi");
    close NULL;
    waitpid $pid, 0;

    $? >> 8 == 0
}

=head2 wrap_perl_cgi

C<< $self->wrap_perl_cgi($path, $action_name) >>

Takes the path to a Perl CGI and returns a coderef suitable for passing to
cgi_to_response (from L<Catalyst::Controller::WrapCGI>.)

C<$action_name> is the generated name for the action representing the CGI file
from C<cgi_action>.

This is similar to how L<ModPerl::Registry> works, but will only work for
well-written CGIs. Otherwise, you may have to override this method to do
something more involved (see L<ModPerl::PerlRun>.)

Scripts with C<__DATA__> sections now work too, as well as scripts that call
C<exit()>.

=cut

sub wrap_perl_cgi {
    my ($self, $cgi, $action_name) = @_;

    my $code = slurp $cgi;

    $code =~ s/^__DATA__(?:\r?\n|\r\n?)(.*)//ms;
    my $data = $1;

    my $coderef = do {
        no warnings;
        # catch exit() and turn it into (effectively) a return
        # we *must* eval STRING because the code needs to be compiled with the
        # overridden CORE::GLOBAL::exit in view
        #
        # set $0 to the name of the cgi file in case it's used there
        eval ' 
            my $cgi_exited = "EXIT\n";

            } }

                . q{open DATA, '<', \$data;}
                . qq{local \$0 = "\Q$cgi\E";}
                . q/my $rv = eval {/
                . $code
                . q/};/
                . q{
                    return $rv unless $@;
                    die $@ if $@ and not (
                      ref($@) eq 'ARRAY' and
                      $@->[0] eq $cgi_exited
                    );
                    die "exited nonzero: $@->[1]" if $@->[1] != 0;
                    return $rv;
                }
         . '}';
    };

    croak __PACKAGE__ . ": Could not compile $cgi to coderef: $@" if $@;

    $coderef
}

=head2 wrap_nonperl_cgi

C<< $self->wrap_nonperl_cgi($path, $action_name) >>

Takes the path to a non-Perl CGI and returns a coderef for executing it.

C<$action_name> is the generated name for the action representing the CGI file.

By default returns:

    sub { system $path }

=cut

sub wrap_nonperl_cgi {
    my ($self, $cgi, $action_name) = @_;
