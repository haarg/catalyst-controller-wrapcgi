CatalystX::GlobalContext - Export Catalyst Context

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MyApp::Controller::Root;

    use CatalystX::GlobalContext ();

    sub auto : Private {
        my ($self, $c) = @_;
        CatalystX::GlobalContext->set_context($c);
        1;
    }

    package Some::Other::Module;

    use CatalystX::GlobalContext '$c';

    ...
    do stuff with $c
    ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module, in combination with L<Catalyst::Controller::WrapCGI> or
L<Catalyst::Controller::CGIBin> is for helping you run legacy mod_perl code in
L<Catalyst>.

You save a copy of $c somewhere at the beginning of the request cycle, and it is
then accessible through an export where you need it.

You can then rip out C<Apache::> type things, and replace them with things based on
C<$c>.

What we really need is a set of C<Apache::> compatibility classes, but that doesn't
exist yet.

DO NOT USE THIS MODULE IN NEW CODE

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=head2 CatalystX::GlobalContext->set_context($c)

Saves a weakened reference to the Catalyst context,
which is accessible from other modules as an export.

sub set_context {
    $c = $_[1];
